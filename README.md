Hey! I'm Victor — a developer with strong experience in process automation, financial operations, and system integration, now expanding into full-scale software development. My core stack includes Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Deluge (Zoho), and I’ve worked with tools like Wrike, Zoho CRM, and Zoho Books to deliver real-world solutions that drive efficiency and reduce manual work.

I’m passionate about building — not just automating. Whether it's scripting, developing backend logic, integrating platforms, or designing smarter workflows, I aim to deliver systems that scale, solve problems, and actually help teams move faster.
