# Victor Gonzalez Hermogenes

Hey! I'm Victor — a developer focused on process automation, financial operations, and custom system integration. My strongest tool is Python, but I also work with JavaScript, SQL, Deluge (Zoho), and tools like Wrike, Zoho CRM, and Zoho Books. I’ve delivered real-world solutions that cut down on manual work, eliminate inefficiencies, and make teams run smoother.

Currently, I’m expanding my work in API integrations, SaaS automation, and smart back-office systems. Whether it's scripting, fixing, testing, or building from scratch — I’m all in.
